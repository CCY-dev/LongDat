Description: Longdat takes longitudinal dataset as input and analyzes if there is significant 
             change of the features over time (a proxy for treatments), while detects and controls 
             for confounders at the same time. Longdat is able to take in several data types as input, 
             including count, proportion, binary, ordinal and continous data. The output table contains 
              p values, effect sizes and confounders of each feature, making the downstream analysis easy.
