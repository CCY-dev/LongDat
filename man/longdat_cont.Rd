\title{Calculate the p values and effect size from longitudinal data}
\usage{
longdat_cont(
  input,
  test_var,
  value_column,
  factor_column,
  non_factors,
  adjustMethod = "fdr",
  model_p = 0.1,
  posthoc_p = 0.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{a table with the first column as "Individual", and all the features
should be at the end of the table. Also, place the columns that aren't
numerical (e.g. categorical, ordinal) in the front of the table, right after "Individual"}

\item{test_var}{the name of the variable you are testing for, should be a character vector
identical to its column name and make sure there is no space in it.}

\item{value_column}{the number of the position where the features columns start in the table}

\item{factor_column}{the number of the position where the columns that aren't
numerical  (e.g. categorical, ordinal) ends in the table}

\item{non_factors}{the factors that are not considered as potential confounders to the factor tested for,
for example, "Individual" and "SampleID" are random factors instead of confounders, so
they should be listed as non_factors}

\item{adjustMethod}{Multiple testing p value correction. Choices are the ones in p.adjust(), including
"holm", "hochberg", "hommel", "bonferroni", "BH", "BY" and "fdr"). The default is "fdr".}

\item{model_p}{The threshold for significance of model test after multiple testing correction.
The default is 0.1.}

\item{posthoc_p}{The threshold for significance of post-hoc test after multiple testing correction.
The default is 0.05.}
