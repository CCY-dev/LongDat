Longitudinal data analysis

pvalue_calc.R & sig_calc.R : The first try to rearrange scripts from CORONA. Pvalue_calc calculates all the p values listed, while sig_calc determines whether the p value is significant or not.

P_value_filtering.R : Writing a new script by myself. It calculates p values, effect sizes for all factors in the data, and also do linear regression modeling for the factors that have passed p value threshold.
